    "**This week you will be using Python, Altair and vega-lite to create two visualizations of the same dataset. These visualizations do NOT need to be linked but AT LEAST ONE needs to be interactive in some way beyond the \"built in\" pan/zoom capabilities.**\n",

Please see notes about this process at the end of this post.  You must list all group member's names on your assignment -- we will not accept submissions without all group members listed.\n",

    "* for EACH PLOT:\n",
    "    * a description of what you are visualizing\n",
    "    * what design choices you made: specifically what encoding types you are using, and if you are using a color scheme -- what variables you are coloring by and why you chose a specific color scheme\n",
    "    * discussion of any data transformations that you did on the analysis side of things in your Python notebook\n",
    "    * if you are using similar plots to your Homework #9 -- make sure you include quotations around any parts of your Homework #9 that you are using in your write up AND what you changed between Homework #9 to this Homework in order to get things to work with Altair\n",

You can link them with \"The Data\" and \"The Analysis\" buttons like in the in-class examples. Make sure this link is to the GitHub page of the notebook!

For both quantitative columns in `chart11` I am aggregating mean values. I didn't need to transform the data, as I felt this general approach would be more widely interesting. Since I used the base viz from Homework 9, I did have to tweak the things a bit for Altair--adding titles and starting first with the bar chart as the base viz and the scatter as the referenced chart. The interactivity here is hopefully clear, but I allow users to select a state's bar (representing Bigfoot sightings) and see each sighting in our data represented as a point plotted between mean humidity and mean temperature on an accompanying chart."
